class SolverPlan:
    """
    This class contains all the information to solve
    the linear system of equations.

    You need to add plans that contains information on how to solve
        A x = C b
    This system can be multidimensional. In that case, multiple plans
    are stitched together and executed sequentially. Order matters here.

    Example:
    >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
    from pypde.solver.plans import *
    from pypde.solver.solverplan import *
    A = np.array([[1,1,2],[0,3,6],[0,0,9]])
    b = np.array([[0,1,2],[3,4,6]])

    # Make Plans
    rhs = PlanRHS(A,ndim=2,axis=1)
    lhs = PlanLHS(A,ndim=2,axis=1,method="numpy")

    # Add them
    solver = SolverPlan()
    solver.add_lhs(lhs)
    solver.add_rhs(rhs)

    # Print them
    solver.show_plan()

    # Solve them
    rhs = solver.solve_rhs(b)
    x = solver.solve_lhs(rhs)
    print(x)

    # The above results should be the same as
    rhs = b@A.T
    np.linalg.solve(A,rhs.T).T
    >  array([[0., 1., 2.],
            [3., 4., 6.]])
